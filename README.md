Hi there! 👋 I'm Sam, a Full Stack Developer crafting seamless apps from frontend flair to backend muscle.

🔭 Currently building: A Trello clone—boards, cards, and workflows that actually work (and feel addictive).
🎓 Post-grad glow-up: Wrapped my IT Bachelor's at Wintec a year ago; now stacking skills in full stack magic.
🌱 On the rise: Diving into blockchain and smart contracts—Ethereum vibes calling my name (resources welcome!).
👯 Collab curious: Up for full stack projects, web apps, or dev experiments—let's build something epic together!
💬 Ask me about: Full stack triumphs (or epic fails), game dev shortcuts, or how Trello changed my chaos-to-clarity game.
📫 Hit me up: sam2319667268@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: Video games fuel my code marathons—because who needs sleep when you've got loot boxes?
